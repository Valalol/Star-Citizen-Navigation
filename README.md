This tool is designed to help you navigate in the universe of Star Citizen.

This project was greatly inspired by the **"Murphy Exploration Group"** and more particularly by **Graupunkt#4414** who carried out a very similar program.

## General Info
This program relies almost entirely on the in-game `/showlocation` command. This command copies the global coordinates (relative to the center of the system) to the clipboard. The tool continuously retrieves the contents of this clipboard and, if coordinates are found, interprets them in order to guide the user to his target.


### Glossary 
- POI = Point Of Interest
- Container = The planets and moons on which the points of interest can be

## Installation

1) Copy and extract the star-citizen-navigation-tool-win32-x64 folder wherever you want.

2) Install Python from the [Python Download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/). **Make sure the Path box at the bottom right is ticked as shown in the screenshot below**, and let it install with default location and settings.

3) Run the `install.bat` to install the library required by the tool (pyperclip).

4) If everything worked, you should be able to launch the program called `star-citizen-navigation-tool.exe` inside the folder you copied over without issues.

5) After inputting your search selections into the cascading selection  boxes, you will manually need to do a `/showlocation` command from within Starcitizen in order for the map to update.
to do this open the Global chat using `F12`. Hit `enter`, and a command line will open for you. Then simply type in `/showlocation` then `enter`, and the tool will update.

6) If you want the tool to draw your lacation on a map, run the `Map.exe` and make sure you've done a few commands in-game. The map depends on the main tool to work.
